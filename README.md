POS tagger
-> pos_tagger.ipynb is the main code and readily implementable with example functions in it.

NOTE: The code is made on jupyter notebook and can be run in blocks.

-> The code has both test data output and has functionality to make POS tags for a given sentence <can be inserted in code at a dedicated location>

Thankyou
